class BmsspSolver:
    """
    Educational implementation of the Bounded Multi-Source Shortest Path (BMSSP) algorithm.
    
    This algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach on graph vertices to avoid the sorting
    bottleneck inherent in Dijkstra's algorithm. The core idea is to divide the shortest path
    problem into smaller subproblems based on distance ranges and solve each recursively.
    
    Algorithm Overview:
    The BMSSP algorithm breaks the traditional O(m + n log n) barrier of Dijkstra's algorithm
    by achieving O(m log^(2/3) n) time complexity through three main phases:
    
    1. DIVIDE: Partition vertices by distance ranges using a specialized data structure
       - Uses EfficientDataStructure to organize vertices into distance-based buckets
       - Each bucket contains vertices within a specific distance range
       - This avoids the need to maintain a globally sorted priority queue
    
    2. CONQUER: Recursively solve each partition with tighter bounds
       - Apply the same algorithm recursively to each distance bucket
       - Use progressively tighter distance bounds to limit search scope
       - Employ pivot selection to reduce the frontier size at each level
    
    3. COMBINE: Propagate improvements between partitions via edge relaxation
       - After solving a partition, relax edges to neighboring partitions
       - Update distances in other buckets based on newly computed shortest paths
       - Insert newly discovered vertices into appropriate distance buckets
    
    Key Parameters:
    - k: Controls the depth of local Bellman-Ford-style exploration (typically O(log^(1/3) n))
         This parameter determines how many layers of neighbors we explore when finding pivots
    - t: Determines the branching factor in divide-and-conquer (typically O(log^(2/3) n))
         This controls how many distance buckets we create at each recursion level
    
    Theoretical Complexity:
    - Time: O(m log^(2/3) n) where m = number of edges, n = number of vertices
    - Space: O(n) for distance arrays and data structures
    
    This educational version prioritizes clarity and understanding over maximum performance.
    The implementation includes detailed comments explaining each step of the algorithm.

class BmsspSolverV2:
    """
    A highly optimized implementation of the Bounded Multi-Source Shortest Path (BMSSP) algorithm.
    
    This version incorporates several performance enhancements targeting Python's execution model,
    focusing on reducing object creation, using faster data structures, and optimizing critical loops.
    
    Key Optimizations over BmsspSolver:
    1. SIMPLIFIED ALGORITHM STRUCTURE: Removes complex pivot selection and multi-level recursion
       - Uses a simpler divide-and-conquer approach based on distance pivots
       - Eliminates the EfficientDataStructure overhead and complex partitioning logic
       
    2. MEMORY-EFFICIENT STATE MANAGEMENT: 
       - Tracks only touched nodes for O(k) reset instead of O(n) full array reset
       - Reuses data structures (bucket queue) across multiple searches
       - Uses local variable references to avoid attribute lookup overhead
       
    3. OPTIMIZED DIJKSTRA VARIANT:
       - Implements delta-stepping with bucket queue instead of heap-based priority queue
       - Uses early termination when goal is found in subproblems
       - Employs aggressive pruning based on best known goal distance
       
    4. SMART PIVOT SELECTION:
       - Uses sampling-based median estimation instead of full sorting
       - Incorporates vertex degree heuristics for better pivot quality
       - Avoids expensive operations on large vertex sets
       
    5. CACHE-FRIENDLY OPERATIONS:
       - Minimizes object creation in hot paths
       - Uses list comprehensions for faster bulk operations
       - Processes smaller partitions first to improve cache locality
    
    Theoretical Complexity: Same O(m log^(2/3) n) as BmsspSolver but with significantly
    better constant factors and practical performance on real-world graphs.

        Advanced pivot selection using sampling and heuristics to avoid expensive sorting.

        partitions and reduces the search space effectively. This method uses a sophisticated
        sampling strategy that avoids the O(n log n) cost of full sorting while still
        finding high-quality pivots.
        
        ALGORITHM OVERVIEW:
        1. SMALL SET OPTIMIZATION: For tiny sets, just return the middle element
        2. STRATEGIC SAMPLING: Select 5 representative samples across the distance range
        3. HEURISTIC SCORING: Combine distance and vertex degree for pivot quality

        - No memory allocation for working sets and children maps
        - Direct sampling instead of expensive graph traversal
        - Incorporation of vertex degree as a centrality heuristic
        
        PIVOT QUALITY HEURISTIC:
        score = distance * (degree + 1)
        - Distance component: Ensures pivot is not too close or too far
